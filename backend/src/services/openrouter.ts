// Note: This file is kept for potential future server-side transcription needs
// Currently, transcription is handled client-side using Web Speech API
// OpenRouter is primarily used for AI conversation generation (see ai.ts)

// If you need server-side transcription in the future, you can:
// 1. Use OpenRouter with a Whisper model
// 2. Use a dedicated transcription service (Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, AWS Transcribe, etc.)
// 3. Use OpenAI's Whisper API directly
